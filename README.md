# IMDB-Sentiment-Classification
Developed an IMDB sentiment classification model using raw text data instead of the Keras IMDB dataset. Key
tasks included text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization), and training a deep learning model to classify
reviews as positive or negative. Subsequently, I leveraged the Keras IMDB dataset to build and compare various
models, including LSTM, GRU, and Conv1D, using both pretrainedWord2Vec embeddings (achieving up to 89%)
and without pretrained embeddings (achieving up to 86.5%).
